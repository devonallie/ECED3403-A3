PURPOSE:
The purpose of this test is to validate the function of loading and storing
with the LDR and STR instructions. This test also test word/byte functionality.

TEST CONFIGURATION:
The following input is given to the terminal after running the program

Option: l
Enter .XME file to load
LDRSTR.xme
Source filename: LDRSTR - A3.asm
File read - no errors detected. Starting address: 2000
Option: g
Start: PC: 2000, PSW: 7FA7, Brkpt: 2010 Clk: 0000
End: PC: 280E, PSW: 7FA7, Brkpt: 2010 Clk: 0031

MOVH and MOVL are called to set R0 to 0x1000
MOLVZ is called to set R1 to 0x00F0
STR.B is called to store the LSB of R1 to memory location 1000
MOVLS is called to SET R2 to 0xFF0F
STR.B is called again, this time to set the LSB of R2 to 0xFF0F
LDR.W is called to take the value at address 0x1000 and setting it to R3

EXPECTED RESULTS:
R0: 1000
R1: 00F0
R2: FF0F
R3: 0FF0
R4: 0000
R5: 0000
R6: 0000
R7: 280E

ACTUAL RESULTS:
R0: 1000
R1: 00F0
R2: FF0F
R3: 0FF0
R4: 0000
R5: 0000
R6: 0000
R7: 280E

The results matched the expected validating the test and the instrucitons.
